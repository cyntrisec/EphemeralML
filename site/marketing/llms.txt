# Cyntrisec — Confidential AI Infrastructure

## EphemeralML

> AI Clean Room for Inference.
> Per-request cryptographic proof that your data was processed inside a hardware-isolated environment — and nowhere else.

### Overview
EphemeralML produces signed receipts (proof bundles) for every AI inference request. Each receipt contains the model hash, input/output hashes, attestation evidence, and an Ed25519 signature. Human-readable. Machine-verifiable.

Models run inside hardware Trusted Execution Environments (Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, AWS Nitro). The cloud operator cannot access data during processing — verified by hardware attestation.

### Key Features
- **Proof Bundle**: Every inference produces a signed receipt with model hash, I/O hashes, attestation evidence, Ed25519 signature.
- **Hardware Isolation**: Intel TDX, AMD SEV-SNP, AWS Nitro Enclaves. Verified by hardware attestation.
- **Encrypted Transport**: Attestation-bound X25519 + ChaCha20-Poly1305. 170ns frame encoding, sub-8us per 4KB.
- **GPU Inference**: Llama 3 8B on NVIDIA H100 Confidential Computing. Quantized GGUF models.
- **Multi-Cloud**: GCP Confidential Space (TDX), AWS Nitro Enclaves, Azure DCads_v5 (SEV-SNP).
- **Open Source**: Rust. Published on crates.io. Apache 2.0 licensed.

### HIPAA Compliance Mapping
- 164.312(a) Access Control → Enclave isolation proof
- 164.312(b) Audit Controls → The receipt itself
- 164.312(c) Integrity → Model hash + attestation signature
- 164.312(e) Transmission Security → AEAD encryption proof
